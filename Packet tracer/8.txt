Do you know the difference between a physical topology and a logical topology?
A physical topology includes the actual physical locations of the devices
and a logical topology is only the theoretical connections between them.   

How are each used?
Physical topology are used when propagation delays are something to consider.
Logical topology are used when only the logic of the network is important.
