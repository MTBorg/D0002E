Task 8:
	Step1:
		A static default route will need to be configured to send all packets with destination addresses
		that are not in the routing table to the loopback address representing the link between

			172.20.56.0
			172.20.56.4

		Will the networks of the HQ LAN and the links between the Branch1 and Branch2 router
 		need to have the subnet mask information included in the network statements?
			Yes?
